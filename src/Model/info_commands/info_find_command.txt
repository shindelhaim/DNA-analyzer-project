The find command finds a sub-sequence within a sequence.
It has two flavors:

1. Takes an expressed sub-sequence
>>>> syntax: find <seq> <expressed_sub_seq> <<<<

2. Refers an existing sub-sequence:
>>>> syntax: find <seq_to_find_in> <seq_to_be_found> <<<<
----------------------------------------------------------------
returns the (0-based) index of the first appearance of <expressed_sub_seq>
in the sequence <seq>.
