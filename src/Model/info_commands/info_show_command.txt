----------------------------------------------------------------
If <num_chars> is provided, then this is the number of chars to print (if the sequence is longer than that).
Otherwise, <num_chars> defaults to 99.

The ID, name and status are printed in the first line.
Then, the sequence itself is printed in the next lines, no more than 99 chars per line.
